Note: 
-Everytime you come back to the project you need to run "npm run build:css" and then run "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/css/main/input.css -o ./src/css/main/output.css --watch". this will tell sass to watch changes in scss folder and generate a css file in the css folder and then Tailwind will tracks and compiles all your changes in the html files that linked with the file "./src/css/main/output.css".

-Run "json-server --watch ./src/data/movies.json --port 9999" to start json server

-Everytime you work on a new page:
    - create new html file in pages folder
    - create new scss style file in "./src/scss/folder_for_the_page" (optional) or you can create a new style directly in "./src/css/folder_for_the_page"
    - Import the style file into "./src/css/main/input.css" file
    - link "/src/css/main/output.css"
